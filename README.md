# Mobile-Based-Internet-Banking-System


Mobile-Based-Internet-Banking-System is a full-stack mobile application. It is a digital banking application with almost all core functionalities included, along with some additional tweaks such as dark mode and a dual implementation for admin and user in the same application. Admins can not sign up using the application and have been added through my firebase project console. For accessing the admin panel, the following credentials can be used:

email: admin@dhl.com
password: adminadmin
Please note that this email is not based off of a valid email. If anyone creates/owns this email, please contact me and I will make sure to replace it.

The front-end and backend implementation are both open-source and have been provided in this repository. If you want to integrate your own firebase project into this application, you can replace the /android/app/google-services.json file with your own.
